# Pascal Thormeier Example

This example can be found (here)[https://dev.to/thormeier/it-s-alive-conway-s-game-of-life-on-a-canvas-25ja]

I literally copied the js and html from the blog opened live server on the html and it works great, and teh article is very well written too.

No external dependencies just pure js/html/css.

At this point the intention is not to properly examine the code since I'll just end up copying it, however if I do get stuck then it's nice to have as a backup.
